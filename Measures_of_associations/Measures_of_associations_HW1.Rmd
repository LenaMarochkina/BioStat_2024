# Task 1

Doctors decided to study how body mass index (BMI) is associated with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The file
diabetes.csv contains data on a random sample of 200 residents of settlement N. For each respondent, the BMI (high or normal) and diabetes status (presence/absence of type 2 diabetes) are known. Determine how high BMI is associated with the development of type 2 diabetes, indicate the relative risk and the absolute risk difference. How do you interpret the results?

```{r diabetis}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
